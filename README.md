# authentication

authentication is my last project for the athena award, and i am also submitting it to the ysws authly. i decieded to code this using python and django, both fairly new to me. the website itself is space themed, where after logging in with an image password, you can add stars youve seen to your star chart.

this project was a big challenge for me because i have never used django before, and this is my second time with python. i picked this project because i wanted my last submission for athena to be challenging and different. i have worked on this for almost 2 weeks and i am so happy to have actually been able to complete it.
